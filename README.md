## Similarity And Ensemble 
Part 1 of the project which is Regression, can be found [here](https://github.com/mdyahassan/CS-475-ML/blob/main/part%201.pdf). Classification is next and can be found [here](https://github.com/mdyahassan/CS-475-ML/blob/main/Similarity_and_Ensamble___Regression%20(1).pdf). Part 3 is Clustering, and it is posted [here](https://github.com/mdyahassan/CS-475-ML/blob/main/Clustering.pdf). Dimensionality Reduction is part 4 and it is found [here](https://github.com/mdyahassan/CS-475-ML/blob/main/Dimensonality_reduction%20(1).pdf). Lastly, we have the Manager Report which is found [here](https://github.com/mdyahassan/CS-475-ML/blob/main/Md_Hassanmanager.pdf).
