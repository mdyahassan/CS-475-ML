# CS-475-ML
As a data analysis and machine learning enthususiast, this portfolio showcases my skills in machine learning and data science especially in Python, R, C++, Java programming languages. I have explored various linear models and developed algorithms from scratch, including Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes. I have also worked on projects related to Similarity and Ensemble methods, which includes Regression, Classification, Clustering, and Dimensionality Reduction. Additionally, I have experience in using Sklearn for ML applications and image classification. In the future, I plan to continue developing my skills in machine learning through personal projects. In order to stay up to date with this rapidly evolving field, I intend to closely monitor the latest research papers and latest updates. Moreover, I also plan on participating in machine learning contests through Hack AI and kaggle competitions which will further enhance my skills. I am also interested in employments opportunities where I can showcase my skills and knowledge and find valuable solutions or findings to real world problems.

## Technical Skills Learned
Upon successfully completing these projects, I was able to gain a lot of valuable technical skills. One notable skill was learning how to program in R, a language that was new to me at the time. Despite initially feeling unfamiliar with it, coming from a background of programming in object-oriented languages, I quickly realized R's value of its different data analysis tools, including its various graphing capabilities. R made it significantly easier to visualize and analyze data. Additionally, my skills in Java, Python, and C++ were strengthened through these projects. Building on my past experience with machine learning during my internship at SWYE360, where I developed an algorithm to predict student performance, I further enhanced my knowledge in this field including gaining an understanding of various machine learning algorithms used for prediction.
## Soft Skills Learned
Aside from all the valuable technical skills, I was also able to gain a diverse set of soft skills. Communication skills that include both written and verbal is very essential while working in a team. Additionally, I learned that effective scheduling and time management is also very important as it allowed me to meet deadlines effectively by prioritizing certain tasks. I was also able to enhance my analytical skills as I am now confident in my ability to analyze complex data and draw meaningful conclusions. Finally I was able to demonstrate my ability to work both independently and in a team setting, working effectively to achieve project goals.
