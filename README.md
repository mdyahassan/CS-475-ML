# CS-475-ML
As a data analysis and machine learning enthususiast, this portfolio showcases my skills in machine learning and data science especially in Python, R, C++, Java programming languages. I have explored various linear models and developed algorithms from scratch, including Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes. I have also worked on projects related to Similarity and Ensemble methods, which includes Regression, Classification, Clustering, and Dimensionality Reduction. Additionally, I have experience in using Sklearn for ML applications and image classification. In the future, I plan to continue developing my skills in machine learning through personal projects. In order to saty up to date with this rapidly evolving field, I intend to closely monitor the latest research papers and latest updates. Furthermore, I also plan on participating in machine learning contests through Hack AI and kaggle competitions which will further enhance my skills. I am also interested in employments opportunites where I can showcase my skills and knowledge and find valuable solutions or findings to real world problems.
